Day 5 of 100-day Python coding challenge

# Password Generator Project

This Python program generates strong passwords based on user specifications.

## Features
- Generates passwords with a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Allows users to choose between a random password generation or custom password length.

## How it Works
The program prompts the user to choose between a random password generation or custom input for password length. For random generation, it selects a random number of characters for each character type. For custom input, the user specifies the number of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols desired in the password. It then creates a password by randomly selecting characters from the specified character sets and shuffling them for added security.

## Requirements
- Python 3

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ezzy401k/superior_password_generator.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd superior password generator
```

3. Run the program:

```bash
python superior password generator.py
```

4. Choose between random password generation ('y') or custom input ('n').

5. Follow the prompts to generate a password based on your preference.

## Example

```python
python psuperior password generator.py
```
